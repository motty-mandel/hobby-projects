# Horiseon website update

## Description
This project entailed an update of HTML semantics to make the code neater and easier to read.
It was also given better accesability features.

## Usage
This code can be used to show how to clean up the original code without changing the website itself.

## Credits
Original code: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.
I used techniques learnt from the prework as well as the bootcamp classes.
Thanks to Robert Kaiser for helping.
